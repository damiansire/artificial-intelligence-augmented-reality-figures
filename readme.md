## Semantic Commits

In this project, we use semantic commits to maintain a clear and organized commit history. This makes it easier to understand the changes made and automates the release process.

The types of semantic commits we use are:

- **chore:** Used for maintenance tasks, such as dependency updates, tool configuration, or documentation changes that do not affect the main source code.

  - Example: `chore: update dependencies to version X`

- **feat:** Used to add new features to the project.

  - Example: `feat: implement login functionality`

- **refactor:** Used to make changes to the code that improve its structure or readability, but do not introduce new functionality or modify existing behavior.

  - Example: `refactor: rename variables for clarity`

- **structure:** Used for changes related to the project's folder structure or overall architecture.

  - Example: `structure: reorganize components folders`

- **docs:** Used for changes related to project documentation, such as README updates, code comments, or online documentation.
- Ejemplo: `docs: update API documentation`
